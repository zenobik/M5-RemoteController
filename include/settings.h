   Open Camera remote control
  Some remote control buttons and selfie sticks work by transmitting a volume key command, which by default will take a photo, but you can change this from the Settings.
  Open Camera also supports some remote control via a Bluetooth or USB keyboard:
    Function key or numeric keypad "*": toggle popup menu
    "/": toggle exposure menu
    Space or numeric keypad "5": Activate shutter (take photo/video), unless the exposure or popup menu is open, and you are in highlight selection mode (see below).
    Up/down arrows, or numeric keypad "8" and "2": if the exposure or popup menu is open, this enters highlight selection mode:
        For the popup menu, move the highlighted row up or down to select a row, then press Space/"5", then you can change the selected icon in that row with the up/down arrows, then press Space/"5" again to select the button.
        For the exposure menu, move the highlighted row up or down to select a row, then press Space/"5", then you can change the selected value or slider with the up/down arrows.
    "+" or "-": Zoom in or out.
